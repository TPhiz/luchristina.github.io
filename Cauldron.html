      <h1>Research</h1>
      To begin my research, I deployed a survey to gather various experiences through grocery shopping.
      <div class="researchimages">
        <div class="researchfrustrations">
          <img src="ResearchAisles.jpg" alt="Research Frustration Walking Between Aisles 44 percent"><br>
          I wanted to know what grocery shoppers were not happy about. This allows me to understand what the underlying issues are. From the chart above <u>these frustrations all relate to time spent</u>.
        </div>
        <div class="researchmethod">
          <img src="ResearchMedium.jpg" alt="Research Mediums of Grocery Lists"><br>
          This question was regarding the method of which a shopper saves their grocery lists. 56% of this sample saves it using their phone's note app (ie. iPhone Notes). Surprisingly, the second most-chosen option was 'memory'. Still, <u>73% of this sample relies on physically or digitally writing down their lists</u>, which means there is a large market for this niche.

          <div class="brandname">
            <h2>The Brand Name</h2>
            After thinking of many lackluster names... I decided on <u>Cauldron</u>. The mysticality of the name makes it interesting. When you think of the word cauldron this might come to your mind:
            <ul>
              <li>A melting pot full of different items</li>
              <li>People creating a concoction/recipe</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="fonts">
            <h2>Font Selection</h2>
            Because there is a lot of information within the app, I wanted to keep the font simple. The font I chose is <u>IBM Plex Sans</u>. While it is nice and simple there is still character to this sans-serif font.
        </div>

        <div class="logos">
          <h2>Logos</h2>
          <img src="logos.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Contending logos"><br>
          These logos above were the contenders. I wanted to try showing a horizontal view as well as an aerial view of the cauldron. In order to make a final decision, I did some preference testing.<br><br>
          <img src="preftesting.png" alt="Preference test screenshot"><br>
          The top two logos were the aerial views with ladles. Some reasons that the top logo was chosen was due to the scalability, character of the half-dipped spoon, and the simplicity.<br><br>
          <img src="finallogo.png" style="width:25%;" alt="final logo"> <img src="Mainpagelogo.png" alt="full name logo" style="width:75%;"><br>
          These are the final logos of Cauldron. The second logo is currently only used on the website where people can go in order to download the app.

          <div class="colors">
            <h2>Color Palette</h2>
            Many food related apps currently on the market utilize a green color for freshness. In order to diversify my application from others, I decided on a <u>peach/grapefruit/mandarin</u> (super fresh!) palette.

            The <b>first iteration</b> consisted of including all the screens needed, but they needed to be designed better and designed of higher quality.
          </div>
          <div class="iteration2">
            The <b>second iteration</b> consisted of layout rearrangements. This transformed each screen dramatically.
          </div>
          <div class="iteration3">
            The <b>third iteration</b> was related to accessibility issues. For example, the search bar used to be a semi-transparent white with a medium grey text. Unfortunately, that was not accessible. I changed the background to a mandarin color with a darker grey font, and that passes AAA accessibility.

        </div>
        I performed usability testing after the high fidelity mockups were complete to see the users' experience of the app. There were two ways a user could create lists/recipes, and I noticed both ways were used. This is great because the quicker a user can learn how to navigate an app, the better the experience it will be for them.<br><br>
        Changes I made included making a link more contrasted against a photo background, adjusting the home page to provide a call to action and to make it look more professional, as well as increasing the opacity in the search bar for better visibility.

      <div class="conclusion">

        <div class="conclusionbox">
          <div class="overall">
            There were many iterations in order to create a good minimum viable product. Layouts are very important, and a layout that one thinks would look best at first may not be the most suitable in the end.
          </div>

          <div class="etc">
            <h2 class="marginfix">What I would've done different</h2>
            Keeping accessibility in mind from the beginning is very important and can save a lot of time during screen updates.<br>
            <h2>If I had more time</h2>
            I would like to deploy this product and really test to see how much time a user saves using this app compare to their usual method!
