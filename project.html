      <h1>Summary</h1>
      Stork is a cloud-based business storage program where remote workers have the ability to securely access files. This is perfect for the on-the-go worker who needs to stay up-to-date with current business items.<br><Br>
      <h1>The Solution</h1>
      We wanted to create a platform where remote users have more accessibility to work from anywhere. Features that are included within the app include file creation, uploads, sending, and collaboration.

      <h1>The Process</h1>
      <section class="userresearch">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
      I started off by deploying a survey to see how others utilize their storage platforms, any pain points they had, and any features they wish they had.
      <ul>
        <li>100% of surveyees currently use a cloud storage platform</li>
        <li>Documents and spreadsheets were the most used file types
(90% and 70% respectively)</li>
        <li>95% of users want high accessibility to their storage platform</li>
        <li>60% of users utilize cloud storage for work</li>
        <li>65% of users want to use the platform on a mobile device</li>
      </ul></section>
      <section class="analysis"><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

      Before I thought about what Stork should have or what it should look like, I wanted to see what other storage platforms on the market have. Through competitive analysis, I found that most storage platforms were personal or enterprise-based. I wanted to create a platform where remote workers can access files in order to be more efficient while on-the-go. See competitive analysis for Google Drive, Box, and DropBox here.

      <h2>Needs</h2>
      From the data we collected through the survey, we found that the biggest needs for users were to save files and to collaborate with others whether it’s for school, work, or leisure. To view the full list of needs, click here.

      <section class="sketches">
      <h2>Sketches and Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      I then moved onto low fidelity wireframes. This iteration helped me figure out what functions were necessary for the application and how each page will look. The necessary pages for Stork included a portal where all files were viewable, an upload and send screen, along with being able to create various types of files. After creating these low fidelity wireframes, I set up a clickable prototype to test out how usable it was. From there, I went back to iterate on the areas that weren’t clear to people.<br>

      <section class="testing">
      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      I then performed usability testing on three individuals. While I’m glad the results turned out to not require many changes, I wanted to continue to think of how I can better the design. I also realized that while this is a low fidelity wireframe, I need to make the wireframe design easy to use for the everyday person.

      <section class="branding">
      <h2>Brand Design</h2>
      The name, Stork, was decided on because they bring new creations, are quick, and [user] friendly. I wanted to give Stork the feeling of being clean and simple. Colors we wanted to stay away from were pastel colors because we didn’t want viewers to think Stork was a baby website. The color palette ended up being a royal blue, cyan, and silver. While the blue doesn’t usually represent excitement, I think the royal blue as seen here was eye-catching enough to spark that feeling. We used sans serif fonts to emit casualness which works well with the overall mood.

      <section class="testing">
      <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
      To ensure users are enjoying the platform the most, I created some options for various artifacts throughout the platform. Although I want the platform to be intuitive, I also want the user to have a great visual experience as well. Preference testing also helps me understand what assets make most sense to others.

      <section class="mockups">
      <h2>High-Fidelity Mockups</h2>
      The high fidelity mockups were iterated to have a different color scheme. I still wanted the platform to look clean and simple, but brighter.

      <section class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      There were many iterations of this product - from sketches through high fidelity mockups. I was originally doubtful about how I could create a cloud-based app that is on the same level or superior to the main storage apps we currently see on the market today. I then realized that I could create a niche platform for remote workers or businesses to manage files. Although this product is focused on businesses, Stork can eventually expand to personal use.
      I wanted this product to be intuitive, modern, and simple, and I believe I hit those marks. While I have the necessary components in the current product, I will continue to add additional features until this product is ready to deploy.
