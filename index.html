         As a child, I used to draw every day! After turning 12, I found my way into digital design and was in awe of other kids like be designing these cool layouts for social media and blogging sites like MySpace, Xanga, and Tumblr. I then taught myself how to use Photoshop and code in HTML/CSS by looking through source codes. Even though I enjoyed learning the coding aspect, seeing my design come to life was the best part of it all!<br><br>Fast forward, I ended up getting a degree in Finance and a great job. While the career path is stable, I began to feel unfulfilled; I yearned to be creative again. Around the same time, I found myself critiqing certain apps and websites, and thinking of how it could be designed better. Not too long after, I discovered the world of User Experience Design and fell in love with it!<br><br>I intend to use my ever-growing knowledge of UX/UI design and HTML/CSS to create products that can be used with ease while providing a delightful visual experience.
